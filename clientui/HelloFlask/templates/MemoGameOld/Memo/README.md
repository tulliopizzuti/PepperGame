# Memory Game

## To run this project, try running `index.html` project in updated and latest browsers with working internet connection for downloading required libraries.

## What Will I Build?
The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a snazzy, well-designed, and feature-packed memory game!

## How It Works
If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. Each turn:

* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.


## What Will I Learn?
The memory game presents the first opportunity to fully combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you'll learn how best to combine them in a complex application. What's the ideal workflow? How many files do you need? Do you write the HTML first? The JavaScript?

## Hints
* We recommend starting off working on a very simple grid of cards. Don't worry about styling, just get something clickable on the page
* Figure out how each card is structured. Remember, you have to represent two sides of the card. Are you going to have two separate elements stacked on top of each other?
* Once you have a grid, add in the click logic to reveal the hidden side of each card
* Next, work on the matching logic. How does your game "know" if a player guesses correctly or incorrectly?
* We recommend saving styling until the very end. Allow your game logic and functionality to dictate the styling.
